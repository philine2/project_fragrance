# AI Perfumer (The Lab 2.0)

We explored the potential of data on perfumes (olfactory notes) to understand how note compositions influence successful fragrance formulas (i.e., the success of perfumes is assessed based on customer ratings). Our project was designed for helping perfumers to create unique and successful perfumes (i.e., given a combination of fragrance, predict the commercial success of a perfume).
